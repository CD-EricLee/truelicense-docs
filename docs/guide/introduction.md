# Introduction 

TrueLicense is an open source engine for license management on the JVM.
Due to its functional and modular design, it scales from simple to complex licensing schemas.

TrueLicense features various interfaces for managing free trial periods, subscriptions, multiple editions,
internationalization and more.

TrueLicense is designed with security in mind:
Your intellectual property gets protected by digitally signing the license keys and obfuscating the string constants as
well as the byte code of your software.
The privacy of your customers gets protected by encrypting the license keys.
The API lets you configure all the cryptographic standards implemented by the security providers which are installed in
the JRE.

Before version 4, TrueLicense was covered by the GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3.
Since version 4, it is covered by the Apache License, Version 2.0.
